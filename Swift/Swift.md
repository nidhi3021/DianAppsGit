## **Control Flow** -- _Raj_

___

### _Control flow_ or _flow of control_ is the order function calls, instructions, and statements that are executed or evaluated when a program is running. 

<br/>

> #### Swift provides a variety of control flow statements.
<br/>

* These include **while** loops to perform a task multiple times

* **_if, guard,_** and **_switch_** statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions

* statements such as **_break_** and **_continue_** to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.

<br/>

>Swift also provides a **for-in loop** that makes it easy to iterate over arrays, dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences.

<br/>

> Swiftâ€™s **switch** statement is considerably more powerful.
