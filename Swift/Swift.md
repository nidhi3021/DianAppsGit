# Swift Learning 

## **<span style="color:Thistle">Variables -- Nidhi**</span>
---
* Variables are place where you can store program data

* They can vary 

* Declare with the _**var**_

```swift
 var str = "Hello"
```
  Because **str** is a variable we can change it:
  ```swift
  str = "Goodbye"
  ```

## **Constants**
---
*Alternative* to the var keyword,if you want to set a value once and never change it.


* Declare with the _**let**_
 
```swift
let pi = 3.141519
```
>**Note**: You can declare multiple _*constants*_ or multiple variables on a single line, separated by commas
