# **Swift Learning**

## **<span style="color:Thistle">Variables -- Nidhi**</span>

* Variables are place where you can store program data

* They can vary 

* Declare with the _**var**_

```swift
 var str = "Hello"
```
  Because **str** is a variable we can change it:
  ```swift
  str = "Goodbye"
  ```

## **Constants**

*Alternative* to the var keyword,if you want to set a value once and never change it.


* Declare with the _**let**_
 
```swift
let pi = 3.141519
```
>**Note**: You can declare multiple _*constants*_ or multiple variables on a single line, separated by commas
<br/>

## **Control Flow** -- _Raj_

___

### _Control flow_ or _flow of control_ is the order function calls, instructions, and statements that are executed or evaluated when a program is running. 

<br/>

> #### Swift provides a variety of control flow statements.
<br/>

* These include **while** loops to perform a task multiple times

* **_if, guard,_** and **_switch_** statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions

* statements such as **_break_** and **_continue_** to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.

<br/>

>Swift also provides a **for-in loop** that makes it easy to iterate over arrays, dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences.

<br/>

> Swiftâ€™s **switch** statement is considerably more powerful.
